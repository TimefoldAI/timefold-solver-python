= JPyInterpreter Architecture

The architecture of JPyInterpreter is composed of several components spread across Python and Java.
The Python components are:

- `jvm_setup.py`, which sets up the JVM and the hooks JPyInterpreter uses to communicate with CPython (to look up packages, call native methods, and converting CPython object to Java object and vice-versa).

- `python_to_java_bytecode_translator.py`, which acts as the Python's frontend to JPyInterpreter.
Users supply a CPython function to translate (and an optional Java functional interface it implements) to `translate_python_bytecode_to_java_bytecode`, which firsts converts that function to a `PythonCompiledFunction`, and then passes it to `PythonBytecodeToJavaBytecodeTranslator` to translate the function.
It also provides the `translate_python_class_to_java_class` function, which is given a user supplied CPython class, converts it to a `PythonCompiledClass`, and passes it to `PythonClassTranslator` to translate the class.

The Java components are:

- `PythonBytecodeToJavaBytecodeTranslator`, which acts as the entrypoint for function translation.
It is responsible for:

** Setting up the `JavaPythonClassWriter` and `MethodVisitor` used for bytecode generation.

** Creating and setting fields on the generated class objects (See <<_pythonbytecodetojavabytecodetranslator>> for details).

** Do the leg work of moving/translating Java parameters (ex: `int`) into `PythonLikeObject`.

** Setup cells variables.

** Delegating to `PythonGeneratorTranslator` when it detects the function being translated is a generator.

** Using `FlowGraph` to calculate the `StackMetadata` of each instruction.

** Calling the `implement` method on every opcode in the `Opcode` list with the `StackMetadata` for the opcode and the `FunctionMetadata` for the overall function.

- `PythonGeneratorTranslator` is like `PythonBytecodeToJavaBytecodeTranslator` but for generators.
It breaks a single generator function into multiple `advance` functions, and generates each `advance` function bytecode independently.

- `FlowGraph`, which calculates the `StackMetadata` that corresponds to each `Opcode`.
It is responsible for unifying the `StackMetadata` from all jump sources for each `Opcode` that is a jump target.
For instance, if two sources with the same target have post `StackMetadata` of `... int` and `... bool` respectively, `FlowGraph` will unify that to `... int` (since `bool` is a subclass of `int`, for better or worse).

- `StackMetadata` stores metadata about the stack and local variables.
Each `Opcode` get its own `StackMetadata` instance.
It is mostly used to perform optimizations; for instance, if we detect the top two items on the stack are `int` and `int` for the `BINARY_ADD` instruction, we can change the (normally complex due to Python semantics) `BINARY_ADD` bytecode into a single method call.

- `FunctionMetadata` stores metadata about the function (for instance, the `MethodVisitor` to use to generate bytecode). Each `Opcode` gets the same `FunctionMetadata` instance.

- `Opcode` are the interface between CPython opcodes and the `Implementors`.
Each describe a particular operation, and usually (but not always) correspond to a CPython opcode.
Some CPython opcodes map to the same `Opcode` implementation.

- `Implementors` are responsible for generating the Java bytecode corresponding to CPython bytecode.
They can be found in the `implementors` package.

The overall process of compiling a function looks like this:

== Types

The builtin types for JPyInterpreter can be found in the `types` package.
They all implement `PythonLikeObject`, the interface the bytecode uses to represent arbitrary objects.
If type flow analysis determines a more specific type can be used (via `StackMetadata`), the more specific type is used directly instead.
`PythonLikeObject` have several methods:

- `\\__getAttributeOrNull`: returns the attribute with the given name if it exists, otherwise returns null.
This is NOT `__getattribute\__` (which is implemented by `$method$\__getattribute\__` instead).
This is more akin to `self.\__dict\__[attribute]`.
The default `$method$\__getattribute__` uses it to get the attribute (with additional magic to handle descriptors, see https://docs.python.org/3.11/howto/descriptor.html#invocation-from-an-instance[the Python descriptor tutorial] for more detail).

- `__getAttributeOrError`: returns the attribute with the given name if it exists, otherwise raises `AttributeError`.
Used in bytecode generation to lookup methods on types.

- `\\__setAttribute`: sets the attribute with the given name to the given value.
This is NOT `__setattr\__` (which is implemented by `$method$\__setattr\__` instead).
This is more akin to `self.\__dict\__[attribute] = value`.
The default `$method$\__setattr__` uses it to set the attribute.

- `\\__deleteAttribute`: deletes the attribute with the given name.
This is NOT `__delattr\__` (which is implemented by `$method$\__delattr\__` instead).
This is more akin to `del self.\__dict\__[attribute]`.
The default `$method$\__delattr__` uses it to delete the attribute.

- `__getType`: returns the type of the object.
Used to implement `type(object)`.

- `__getGenericType`: returns the generic type of the object (ex: `list[int]`).
Used for typeflow analysis.

- `$method$<method-name>`: the builtin methods on every object in Python.
The `$method$<method-name>` naming is to allow custom classes to override them (custom classes prefix method names with `$method$` to not clash with Java method names).

== PythonBytecodeToJavaBytecodeTranslator

The entrypoint for function translation, and the glue code for the many subsystems of the translator.
It is responsible for setting up the `JavaPythonClassWriter`, `MethodVisitor` and configuring the class' fields.
The fields it configures are:

- `co_consts`: Static; a `List<PythonLikeObject>` that stores constants used in the bytecode.

- `co_names`: Static; a `List<PythonString>` that stores names used in the bytecode.

- `co_varnames`: Static; a `List<PythonString>` that stores variable names used in the bytecode.

- `\\__globals__`: Static; a `Map<String, PythonLikeObject>` used to read and store globals.

- `\\__spec_getter__`: Static; a `BiFunction<PythonLikeTuple, PythonLikeDict, ArgumentSpec<PythonLikeObject>>` that maps default arguments (which are per function) to an `ArgumentSpec` that can be used to set parameters.

- `\\__defaults__`: Instance; a `PythonLikeTuple` that stores default positional arguments.

- `\\__kwdefaults__`: Instance; a `PythonLikeDict` that stores default keyword arguments.

- `\\__annotations__`: Instance; a `PythonLikeDict` that stores type annotations on the function.

- `\\__closure__`: Instance; a `PythonLikeTuple` that stores the function's closure (i.e. the free variable cells).

- `\\__qualname__`: Instance; a `PythonString` that stores the qualified name of the function.

- `\\__spec__`: Instance; an `ArgumentSpec` that can be used to receive parameter (and correctly handle default arguments).

- `\\__interpreter__`: Instance; the `PythonInterpreter` this function runs in (used to perform imports and lookup unknown globals).

If a Python function cannot be translated for any reason (ex: native code), the following fields are also added:

- `\\__code__`: Static; an opaque pointer to the function's CPython code object (used in the construct to make the wrapped CPython function).

- `\\__function__`: Instance; a `PythonObjectWrapper` that wraps the CPython function (used to call the CPython function).
