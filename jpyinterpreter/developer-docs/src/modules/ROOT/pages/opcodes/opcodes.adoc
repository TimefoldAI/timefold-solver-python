[[cpythonOpcodes]]
= CPython Opcode Instructions

CPython compiles function into bytecode.
The opcodes for this bytecode are listed here and can also be found in `OpcodeIdentifier`.
CPython bytecode structure in not stable, and opcode behaviour may change between releases.

== General Format

Each opcode will be listed in the following format:

```
Opcode Name

Python Versions

Stack Prior: ... [expected stack state]
Stack After: ... [new stack state]

Description of Opcode

Example sources that generate the opcode
```

For instance, the `POP_TOP` opcode, which pop a single item off the top of the stack, would look like this:

```
POP_TOP

Python Versions: ALL

Stack Prior: ... item
Stack After: ...

Pops a single item off the stack.
Used to discard return value of functions and to manipulate the stack.

Example Sources:
my_fun() # POP_TOP is generated after the function call
         # since the result of my_fun is unused.
```


== Instruction Addressing

Prior to 3.10, instructions are addressed by byte offsets.
So the first instruction would have address 0, the second instruction would have address 2, and the third instruction would have address 4.
After 3.10, instructions are addressed by instruction offsets.
So the first instruction would have address 0, the second instruction would have address 1, and the third instruction would have address 2.

Absolute jumps go to the instruction with the address given by the argument.
So an absolute jump with argument 2 will go to the instruction at address 2 regardless of the jump's address.

Relative jumps go to the instruction that are argument addresses away from it.
So a relative jump with argument 2 will go to the instruction at address 3 if the jump is at address 1, or 4 if the jump is at address 2.


[#_cell_variable_index]
== Cell Variable Index

In Python 3.10 and below, the argument for `LOAD_CLOSURE`, `LOAD_CLASSDEREF`, `LOAD_DEREF`, `STORE_DEREF` and `DELETE_DEREF` correspond to the index of the variable name in the combined list `co_cellvars + co_freevars`.
For instance, if `co_cellvars = ['a', 'b']` and `co_freevars = ['c', 'd']`, the argument to read/modify/delete the variable corresponding to each name would be:

- 'a': 0
- 'b': 1
- 'c': 2
- 'd': 3

In Python 3.11, the indices for cell variables that do not correspond to parameters are offset by `co_varnames`. If a cell variable corresponds to a parameter, it uses the parameter index in `co_varnames` as its cell index. For instance, if `co_varnames = ['a', 'x', 'y']`, `co_cellvars = ['a', 'b']` and `co_freevars = ['c', 'd']`, the argument to read/modify/delete the variable corresponding to each name would be:

- 'a': 0
- 'b': 3
- 'c': 4
- 'd': 5

== Opcode Listing

=== NOP

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Does absolutely nothing.
Exists purely to simplify bytecode generation.

Example Sources:

```python
pass  # `pass` represent a NOP in Python
```

=== RESUME

Python Versions: 3.11+

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

A NOP opcode that CPython uses to perform internal tracing, debugging and optimization checks.
Generally put into places where the CPython interpreter enters a function (the start of every function and after yield statements).

Example Sources:

```python
def function():
    # A RESUME opcode is placed at the start of every
    # function.
    return None
```

```python
yield 10 # A RESUME opcode is placed after
         # each YIELD_VALUE opcode
```

=== CACHE

Python Versions: 3.11+

A NOP opcode that CPython uses to record runtime conditions for the https://peps.python.org/pep-0659/[specializing adaptive interpreter].
For instance, if CPython detects a BINARY_OP opcode is usually performed on two `int`,
the CPython interpreter writes that information into the CACHE opcodes that precede the BINARY_OP to specialize the BINARY_OP into `INT_BINARY_ADD`.
JPyIntepreter does specialization at compile time using information from type annotation and typeflow analysis.

Example Sources:

```python
# Several CACHE instruction precede the
# BINARY_OP
x + y
```

=== POP_TOP

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... item

=== BINARY_OP(op)

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ... left_operand, right_operand
Stack After: ... result
```

Perform the binary operator indicated by the opcode's argument on the top two items on the stack (popping them), and push the result to the top of stack.
An binary op can either be inplace or not in place.
Inplace opcodes try the binary op's inplace method first,
then fall back to the standard binary op handling.
The argument to binary operator mapping can be found in https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/0faa0ba240e815614e5a2900e48007acac41b214/Python/ceval.c#L299[CPython source code].
In general, first are the non-inplace opcodes in alphabetical order, followed by the inplace opcodes in alphabetical order.

The left operand is always the first element below the top of stack, and the right operand is always the top of stack. The binary operation is performed as followed:

* Get the method for the binary operation from the left operand's type.

* If the method is present:

** Call the resolved method with the left and right operands.
** If the result is not `NotImplemented`, then it the result of this `BINARY_OP` and go to the next bytecode instruction.
** If the result is `NotImplemented`, treat it as if the left operand's type did not have the method.
** If the left operand a builtin type and the method raises a `TypeError`, treat it as if the left operand's type did not have the method.

* If the method is not present:

** Get the method for the reflected version of the binary operation from the right operand's type.

** If the reflected method is present:

*** Call the reflected resolved method with the right and left operands.
*** If the result is not `NotImplemented`, then it the result of this `BINARY_OP` and go to the next bytecode instruction.
*** If the result is `NotImplemented`, treat it as if the right operand's type did not have the reflected method.

** If the reflected method is not present, raise a `TypeError` with the message `f"unsupported operand type(s) for {symbol(BINARY_OP)}: '{type(left_operand)}' and '{type(right_operand)}'"`

In Python, it would look like this:

```python
def binary_op(BINARY_OP, left_operand, right_operand):
    UNSUPPORTED_OP_MSG = f"unsupported operand type(s) for {symbol(BINARY_OP)}: '{type(left_operand)}' and '{type(right_operand)}'"
    def reflected_binary_op():
        right_method = getattr(type(right_operand), reflected(BINARY_OP), None)
        if right_method is not None:
            reflected_out = right_method(right_operand, left_operand)
            if reflected_out is NotImplemented:
                raise TypeError(UNSUPPORTED_OP_MSG)
            else:
                return reflected_out

    if is_in_place(BINARY_OP):
        inplace_method = getattr(type(left_operand), BINARY_OP, None)
        if inplace_method is not None:
            out = inplace_method(left_operand, right_operand)
            if out is not NotImplemented:
                return out
        BINARY_OP = get_standard_binary_op(BINARY_OP)
    left_method = getattr(type(left_operand), BINARY_OP, None)
    if left_method is not None:
        try:
            out = left_method(left_operand, right_operand)
            if out is not NotImplemented:
                return out
        except TypeError:
            if type(left_operand) in BUILTIN_TYPES:
                return reflected_binary_op()
            raise

Pops the async iterable off the stack, call its  `\\__aiter__` method, and push the result. Used to implement async for loops.

Example Sources:

```python
# The for loop performs GET_AITER on async_iterable to get the async iterator.
# GET_ANEXT is then called on the async iterator.
# The object returned by GET_ANEXT is sent None,
# and the object returned from the send operation is the next item in the async for loop.
async for item in iterable:
    print(item)
```
The bytecode in 3.11 looks like this:
```

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ... async_iterable, exception
Stack After: ...
```

Terminates an async for loop.

Behavior prior to 3.11:

If `ex_type2` is `StopAsyncIteration`, pop 7 values from the stack, restoring exception state from `tb1`, `ex1` and `ex_type1`.
Otherwise, re-raise `ex2`.

Behavior after 3.11:

If `exception` is an instance of `StopAsyncIteration`, pop both `async_iterable` and `exception` off the stack.
Otherwise, re-raise `exception`.

Example Sources:

See <<GET_AITER>> for an example.


=== BEFORE_ASYNC_WITH

Python Versions: >= 3.5

```
Stack Prior: ... async_context_manager
Stack After: ... async_exit_function, async_enter_result
```

Pops `async_context_manager` off the stack and resolve its `\\__aexit__` and `\\__aenter__` methods.
The `\\__aexit__` function is pushed to the stack,
followed by the object return by calling `\\__aenter__`.
Used to implement asynchronous context managers

Example Sources:

```python
async with async_context_manager as async_context:
    pass
```


=== SETUP_ASYNC_WITH

Python Versions: >= 3.5, \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Create the `try...finally` block used for asynchronous context managers.

Example Sources:

```python
async with async_context_manager as async_context:
    pass
```


=== PRINT_EXPR

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... to_print
Stack After: ...
```

Pops off the top of the stack, calls its `\\__repr__` method, and prints the result.
Used by the CPython interactive interpreter to print an entered expression.
It is never emitted as an opcode in a function.

Example Sources:

It cannot be emitted in a function, and thus has no example sources.
It is emitted as the final opcode when the CPython interactive interpreter compiles an expression outside a block.

=== SET_ADD(i)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

Pops off the top of the stack and call `s_i.add(s_0)`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement set comprehensions.

Example Sources:

```python
{point for point in point_list}
```


=== LIST_APPEND(i)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

Pops off the top of the stack and call `s_i.append(s_0)`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement list comprehensions.

Example Sources:

```python
[point for point in point_list]
```


=== MAP_ADD(i)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0, value
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

Pops off the top two items on the stack and call `s_i.\\__setitem__(s_0, value)`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement dict comprehensions.

Example Sources:

```python
{key: value for key, value in item_list}
```

=== RETURN_VALUE

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... return_value
Stack After: N/A
```

Returns the item at the top of the stack.

Example Sources:

```python
def function():
    pass # A `return None` is placed at the end of the function
```

```python
return  # This is actually `return None` in disguise
```

```python
return value
```

=== RETURN_GENERATOR

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Creates a new generator from the current frame.
Used to implement generators.

Generators basically act as two separate functions:

* One outer function that just set locals and return a generator object that wraps the inner function.
* One inner function that yield values.

In this way, it is similar to returning a new anonymous class in a Java function, where we need to pass the function locals to the anonymous class.

However, unlike Java, the outer function and the inner function share the same bytecode. So a generator will start with the `RETURN_GENERATOR` opcode (which returns the generator object), followed by the bytecode for the generator.

JPyInterpreter treats this opcode as a no-op, since we use separate classes for the outer function and the inner functions.

Example Sources:

```python
def function():
    # A RETURN_GENERATOR will be placed at the start
    # of the generator
    yield
```


=== GEN_START(kind)

Python Versions: == 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ... top
Stack After: ...
```

Pops off the top of stack.
This is the first opcode for generators in 3.10.
The stack is not empty, since calling a generator is the same as sending the generator `None`, which push `None` to the top of the stack.
The `kind` argument indicates what kind of generator it is:

- 0 is a normal generator.
- 1 is a coroutine.
- 2 is an async generator.

Example Sources:

```python
def function():
    # A GEN_START(0) will be placed at the start
    # of the generator
    yield
```


=== SEND(target_delta)

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior:                            ... subgenerator, sent_value
Stack if subgenerator is not exhausted: ... subgenerator, yielded_value
Stack if subgenerator is exhausted:     ... subgenerator
```

Pops off the top of stack, and sends it to the sub-generator of this generator.
If the sub-generator is not exhausted, the yielded value is pushed to the top of the stack.
Otherwise, jump forward by `target_delta`, leaving `subgenerator` on the stack.
Used to implement `yield from` and `await` statements.

Example Sources:

```python
# yield from subgenerator is implemented as the following loop
# (with None initially at the top of the stack)
#
# SEND (sends the top of stack to the subgenerator)
# YIELD_VALUE (returns the yielded value to the caller)
# JUMP_BACKWARDS (to SEND)
#
# Before the loop, GET_YIELD_FROM_ITER is used to get the generator
# that will act as the subgenerator
yield from subgenerator
```

```python
# await is a yield from in disguise,
# and is implemented by the same loop
#
# Before the loop, GET_AWAITABLE is used to get the awaitable
# that will act as the subgenerator
await awaitable
```


=== YIELD_VALUE

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... yielded_value
Stack After: ... sent_value
```

Pops off the top of the stack and yields it to the calling function.
The function is then paused, and is resumed by either a `.send(sent_value)` or `.throw(raised_exception)` call.
If `.send(sent_value)` is used, that value is pushed to the top of the stack.
Otherwise, the exception passed to `.throw(raised_exception)` is raised at this opcode position.
Calling `next` on a generator acts as `generator.send(None)`.

Example Sources:

```python
# the sent value is ignored here
yield 10
```

```python
# the sent value is stored in sent_value here
sent_value = yield 10
```


=== YIELD_FROM

Python Versions: >= 3.3, \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ... subgenerator, sent_value
Stack After: ... final_yielded_value
```

Pops off the top of the stack, and set this generator subgenerator to the element immediately below it.
Control is then passed to the subgenerator.
If the subgenerator is not a generator but an iterable, it is treated as the following pseudo-generator:

```python
def iterable_generator(iterable):
    for item in iterable:
        sent_value = yield item
        if sent_value is not None:
            raise AttributeError(f"'{type(iter(iterable))}' object has no attribute 'send'")

```

When the subgenerator is not exhausted, `send` and `throw` calls are proxied to it.
When the subgenerator is exhausted, its final yielded value is pushed to the top of the stack and this generator resumes.

In Python 3.11 and above, the YIELD_FROM opcode is replaced by a SEND + YIELD_VALUE while loop, as documented in the <<SEND(target_delta)>>.

Example Sources:

```python
yield from subgenerator
```

=== SETUP_ANNOTATIONS

Python Versions: >= 3.6

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Checks if the variable `\\__annotations__` is defined.
If `\\__annotations__` is not defined, it is initialized to an empty `dict`.
Otherwise, `\\__annotations__` keep it current value.
It is emitted for a class and module bodies which contain static variable annotations.
This opcode is not emitted for function bodies.

Example Sources:

```python
class MyClass:
    # SETUP_ANNOTATIONS is emitted here,
    # for a later __annotations__['x'] = int
    # call
    x: int
```


=== IMPORT_STAR

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... modulevalue
Stack After: ...
```

Loads all symbols not starting with '_' directly from the module located at the top of the stack to the local namespace.
The module is popped after loading all names, whose values are copied to the module's local variables.
This opcode implements `from module import *`.
It is illegal to use `from module import *` in a function.

Example Sources:

```python
from module import *
```


=== POP_BLOCK

Python Versions: \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Pops the block that store exception handler information off the stack.
Since the JVM store the exception table separate from the bytecode, this is a no-op for JPyInterpreter.
In CPython 3.11, the CPython interpreter also stores the exception table separate from the bytecode, removing the need for this opcode.

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    something()
    # A POP_BLOCK opcode is placed
    # at the end of a try block.
except:
    pass
```


=== POP_EXCEPT

Python Versions: ALL

Python 3.10 and below
```
Stack Prior: ... traceback, exception, exception_type
Stack After: ...
```

Python 3.11 and above
```
Stack Prior: ... exception
Stack After: ...
```

Pop off exception data off the stack, which is used to restore the exception state.
Before Python 3.11, this pop off three values (traceback, exception and type(exception)).
After Python 3.11, this pop off one value (exception).
This is placed at the beginning of every except block

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    something()
except:
    # A POP_EXCEPT opcode is placed
    # at the beginning of an except block.
    pass
```


=== PUSH_EXC_INFO

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ... top
Stack After: ... exception, top
```

Inserts the currently active exception behind the item currently at the top of stack.
Used to allow the current exception to be stored if an except block uses it.

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    pass

# A PUSH_EXC_INFO is emitted at the start of the
# try block exception handler, which goes through
# a series of conditional jumps to determine which
# except block to enter.
# The except block then decide if they should store
# the current exception, or pop it off the stack.
except ValueError as e:
    pass
except Exception:
    pass
```


=== CHECK_EXC_MATCH

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ... exception, exception_type
Stack After: ... exception, test_result
```

Test if `exception` is an instance of `exception_type`.
If so, it pushes `True` to the top of stack; otherwise, it pushes `False`.
`exception_type` is popped off the stack; `exception` remains on the stack.
Used to implement `except` blocks that catch particular types of exceptions.

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    pass
except ValueError:  # CHECK_EXC_MATCH is used here with
                    # exception and ValueError
                    # on the stack.
    pass
```


=== RERAISE(set_f_lasti)

Python Versions: >= 3.9

If `set_f_lasti` is not set
```
Stack Prior: ... exception_or_type
Stack After: N/A
```

If `set_f_lasti` is set
```
Stack Prior: ... index, exception_or_type
Stack After: N/A
```

The item at the top of the stack is either an exception or type.
If it is an exception, throw it.
If it is a type, construct and throw a new instance of that type.
Used to implement a bare `raise` in an except block.

Note: CPython uses the `index` below the exception/type to set the last index if the bytecode argument not 0.
JPyInterpreter can ignore the argument, since the JVM keep track of frames for us.

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    pass
except:
    raise  # this emits RERAISE
```


=== WITH_EXCEPT_START

Python Versions: >= 3.9

Before 3.11
```
Stack Prior: ... exit_function, instruction, stack_size, label, traceback, exception, exception_type
Stack After: N/A
```

After 3.11
```
Stack Prior: ... exit_function, traceback, exception, exception_type
Stack After: N/A
```

Calls `exit_function` with arguments `exception_type, exception, traceback`, and push the returned value to the top of the stack.
The returned value should be a boolean.
If the returned value is Truthy, the context manager handled the exception and execution continue.
If the returned value is Falsy, the exception is propagated.
If no exception occurred, exception_type, exception, traceback are all None.


Example Sources:

```python
with context:
    pass
```


=== LOAD_ASSERTION_ERROR

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... AssertionError
```

Pushes the type `AssertionError` onto the stack.
Used in `assert` statements.

Example Sources:

```python
assert False
```


=== LOAD_BUILD_CLASS

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... __build_class__
```

Pushes the function `builtins.\\__build_class__` onto the stack.
Used to construct classes.
The function signature for `\\__build_class__` is:

```python
def __build_class__(class_body: function,
                    class_name: str,
                    *bases: List[Type],
                    metaclass: Type,
                    **metaclass_parameters: Dict[str, Any]) \
                    -> Type
```

Example Sources:

```python
class C:
    pass

# this translates roughly to:
# __build_class__(<func>, 'C')
```

```python
class C(A, B):
    pass

# this translates roughly to:
# __build_class__(<func>, 'C', A, B)
```

```python
class C(A, metaclass=M, metaclass_arg=1):
    pass

# this translates roughly to:
# __build_class__(<func>, 'C', A, metaclass=M, metaclass_arg=1)
```


=== SETUP_WITH(except_delta)

Python Versions: \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ... context_manager
Stack After: ... exit_function, start_function_result
Stack On Exception: ... instruction, stack_size, label, traceback, exception, exception_type
```

Pops off the top of the stack, and push its `\\__exit__` function and the result of calling its `\\__enter__` function to the top of the stack.
`except_delta` points to the exception handler for the which block.
If an exception occurs, the follow items will be pushed to the stack:

. The bytecode instruction index that was executing when the exception happened.

. The size of the stack before the with block.

. The exception handler label.

. The traceback for the exception.

. The actual exception.

. The type of the exception.

Example Sources:

```python
with context_manager:
    pass
```


=== STORE_NAME(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... value
Stack After: ...
```

Sets either the global or local variable with the name `co_names[namei]` to the item currently at the top of stack.
The top of stack is then popped.
This opcode is only emitted for module bodies and classes.

Example Sources:

```python
class C:
    x = 10 # this emits a STORE_NAME('x') opcode
           # with 10 on the top of the stack
```


=== DELETE_NAME(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Deletes either the global or local variable with the name `co_names[namei]`.
This opcode is only emitted for module bodies and classes.

Example Sources:

```python
class C:
    x = 10
    del x # this emits a DELETE_NAME('x') opcode
```

=== UNPACK_SEQUENCE(count)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... iterable
Stack After: ... item_{count - 1}, ..., item_1, item_0
```

Top of stack is an iterable.
In reverse order, push its items to the stack (making the new item at the top of stack the first item in the iterable).
The iterable is then popped off the stack.
If the iterable does not have exactly `count` items, a `ValueError` is raised.
The items are received using an iterator loop:

```python
iterator = iter(iterable)
items = []
while True:
    try:
        items.append(next(iterator))
    except StopIteration:
        break

```

Example Sources:

```python
# This is compiled as:
# UNPACK_SEQUENCE(2)
# STORE_FAST('x') (1)
# STORE_FAST('y') (2)
x, y = (1, 2)
```


=== UNPACK_EX((high byte) end_index | (low byte) start_index)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... iterable
Stack After: ... after_0, after_1, ..., after_{end_index - 1}, extra, before_{start_index - 1}, ..., before_1, before_0
```

Top of stack is an iterable.
Collect its item into a list.
Push each item in the slice [-end_index:] to the stack in forward order (empty if end_index == 0).
Push a list containing the slice [start_index:end_index] to the stack as a single item.
Push each item in the slice [:start_index] in reverse order (empty if start_index == 0).
The iterable is then popped off the stack.
If the iterable does not have at least `start_index + end_index` items, a `ValueError` is raised.
The items are received using an iterator loop:

```python
iterator = iter(iterable)
items = []
while True:
    try:
        items.append(next(iterator))
    except StopIteration:
        break

before = items[:start_index]
after = items[-end_index:]
extra = items[start_index:end_index]
```

Example Sources:

```python
# This is compiled as:
# UNPACK_EX((2 << 8) | 1) (= 513)
# STORE_FAST('b_0') (1)
# STORE_FAST('extra') ([2, 3])
# STORE_FAST('a_0') (4)
# STORE_FAST('a_1') (5)
b_0, *extra, a_0, a_1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```


=== STORE_ATTR(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... value, object
Stack After: ...
```

Sets the attribute with the name `co_names[namei]` on the object at the top of the stack to the value immediately below it.
Both the object and the value are popped.
The value is set by calling the `\\__setattr__(self, name: str, value: Any)` method on the type of object with `object`, `co_names[namei]` and `value` as the arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# equivalent to
# type(my_object).__setattr__(my_object, 'attribute', value)
my_object.attribute = value
```


=== DELETE_ATTR(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... object
Stack After: ...
```

Deletes the attribute with the name `co_names[namei]` on the object at the top of the stack.
The object is then popped off the stack.
The value is deleted by calling the `\\__delattr__(self, name: str)` method on the type of object with `object` and `co_names[namei]` as the arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# equivalent to
# type(my_object).__delattr__(my_object, 'attribute')
del my_object.attribute
```


=== STORE_GLOBAL(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... value
Stack After: ...
```

Sets the global variable with the name `co_names[namei]`  to the value currently at the top of the stack.
The value is then popped from the stack.
Each module has a unique global namespace used to store global variables.
Functions in the same module use the same namespace.

Example Sources:

```python
# required, otherwise it be a STORE_FAST
global variable
variable = 5
```


=== DELETE_GLOBAL(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Deletes the global variable with the name `co_names[namei]`.
Each module has a unique global namespace used to store global variables.

global variable
del variable
```


=== LOAD_CONST(consti)

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... constant
```

Loads the constant `co_constants[consti]`.

Example Sources:

```python
'A string constant'
```

```python
1  # an int constant
```

```python
(1, 2, 3)  # a tuple constant
```


=== LOAD_NAME(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... value
```

Pushes either the global or local variable with the name `co_names[namei]` to the top of stack.
This opcode is only emitted for module bodies and classes.

Example Sources:

```python
class C:
    x # this emits a LOAD_NAME('x') opcode
```


=== BUILD_TUPLE(count)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... item_0, item_1, ..., item_{count - 1}
Stack After: ... item_tuple
```

Construct a tuple from the top `count` items on the stack.
The items are placed in the reverse order that they are encountered from the top of stack (making the top of stack the last element).
The top `count` items are then popped from the stack, and the newly constructed tuple is pushed to the stack.

Example Sources:

```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = (x, y)  # This creates a BUILD_TUPLE opcode:
# LOAD_FAST('x')
# LOAD_FAST('y')
# BUILD_TUPLE(2)
```


=== BUILD_LIST(count)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... item_0, item_1, ..., item_{count - 1}
Stack After: ... item_tuple
```

Construct a list from the top `count` items on the stack.
The items are placed in the reverse order that they are encountered from the top of stack (making the top of stack the last element).
The top `count` items are then popped from the stack, and the newly constructed list is pushed to the stack.

Example Sources:

```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = [x, y]  # This creates a BUILD_LIST opcode:
# LOAD_FAST('x')
# LOAD_FAST('y')
# BUILD_LIST(2)
```


=== BUILD_SET(count)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... item_0, item_1, ..., item_{count - 1}
Stack After: ... item_tuple
```

Construct a set from the top `count` items on the stack.
The items are placed in the reverse order that they are encountered from the top of stack (making the top of stack the last element).
The top `count` items are then popped from the stack, and the newly constructed set is pushed to the stack.
The items lower in the stack are prioritized over items higher in stack (i.e. if `item_0 == item_1`, then `item_0` be added to the set, not `item_1`).

Example Sources:

```python
x = 1
y = 2
z = {x, y}  # This creates a BUILD_SET opcode:
# LOAD_FAST('x')
# LOAD_FAST('y')
# BUILD_SET(2)
```


=== BUILD_MAP(count)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... , key_0, value_0, key_1, value_1, ..., key_{count - 1}, value_{count - 1}
Stack After: ... item_map
```

Construct a dict from the top `2 * count` items on the stack.
The items are put in the reverse order that they are encountered from the top of stack (making the top two items on the stack the last key-value pair).
The top `2 * count` items are then popped from the stack, and the newly constructed dict is pushed to the stack.
The items higher in the stack are prioritized over items higher in stack (i.e. if `key_0 == key_1`, then `key_1 = value_1` be put in the dict, not `key_0 = value_0`).

Example Sources:

```python
key_0 = 1
value_0 = 2
key_1 = 3
value_1 = 4
z = {
    key_0: value_0,
    key_1: value_1
}
# This creates a BUILD_MAP opcode:
# LOAD_FAST('key_0')
# LOAD_FAST('value_0')
# LOAD_FAST('key_1')
# LOAD_FAST('value_1')
# BUILD_MAP(2)
```


=== BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP(count)

Python Versions: >= 3.6

```
Stack Prior: ... , value_0, value_1, ..., value_{count - 1}, key_tuple
Stack After: ... item_map
```

Construct a dict from the top `count + 1` items on the stack.
The item at the top of the stack is a tuple of constants of length count, which stores the dict's keys.
There are `count` items below it representing each key's corresponding value.
The key-value pairs are put in the reverse order that they are encountered from the top of stack (making `key_tuple[-1], value_{count - 1}` the last key-value pair to be added to the dict).
The top `count + 1` items are then popped from the stack, and the newly constructed dict is pushed to the stack.
The items higher in the stack are prioritized over items higher in stack (i.e. if `tuple[0] == tuple[1]`, then `tuple[1] = value_1` be put in the dict, not `tuple[0] = value_0`).

Example Sources:

```python
value_0 = 1
value_1 = 2
z = {
    'a': value_0,
    'b': value_1
}
# This creates a BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP opcode:
# LOAD_FAST('value_0')
# LOAD_FAST('value_1')
# LOAD_CONSTANT (('a', 'b'))
# BUILD_CONST_KEY_MAP(2)
```


=== BUILD_STRING(count)

Python Versions: >= 3.6

```
Stack Prior: ... string_0, string_1, ..., string_{count - 1}
Stack After: ... result
```

Concatenate the top `count` items on the stack into a single string.
Each of the top `count` items on the stack must be a string.
The strings are concatenated from the lowest item up
(i.e. `string_0 + string_1 + ... + string_{count - 1}`).
Used to implement f-strings.

Example Sources:

```python
a = 'before'
b = 'after'
f'{a} {b}'
# Bytecode:
# LOAD_FAST(a)
# FORMAT_VALUE(str)
# LOAD_CONST(' ')
# LOAD_FAST(b)
# FORMAT_VALUE(str)
# BUILD_STRING(3)
```


=== LIST_TO_TUPLE

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ... list
Stack After: ... tuple
```

The top of the stack is a list.
Pop off the top of the stack, and replace it with a tuple with the same values in the same order.
Used to unpack a list into a tuple.

Example Sources:

```python

=== LIST_EXTEND(i)

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

The top of the stack is an iterable and `s_i` is a list.
Pop off the top of the stack, and add its contents to `s_i`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement list unpacking.

Example Sources:

See <<LIST_TO_TUPLE>>.


=== SET_UPDATE(i)

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

The top of the stack is an iterable and `s_i` is a set.
Pop off the top of the stack, and add its contents to `s_i`.
The added content will not replace items already in the `set`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement set unpacking.


Example Sources:

```python
{*(1, 2, 3)}
# BUILD_SET(0)  # Create an empty set to
#               # store the result
#
# LOAD_CONST((1, 2, 3))  # Load the constant (1, 2, 3)
#
# SET_UPDATE(1)  # Unpacks (1, 2, 3) into the result
```


=== DICT_UPDATE(i)

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

The top of the stack is an mapping and `s_i` is a dict.
Pop off the top of the stack, and add its contents to `s_i`.
The added content will replace the value assigned to keys already in the `dict`.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement dict unpacking.


Example Sources:

```python
{
    'a': 1,
    **b
}
# LOAD_CONSTANT('a')
# LOAD_CONSTANT(1)
#
# BUILD_MAP(1)  # Create a dict with items
#               # ('a', 1)
#
# LOAD_FAST(n)  # Load b
#
# DICT_UPDATE(1)  # Unpacks b into the result dict
```


=== DICT_MERGE(i)

Python Versions: >= 3.9

```
Stack Prior: ... s_i, ..., s_1, s_0
Stack After: ... s_i, ..., s_1
```

The top of the stack is an mapping and `s_i` is a dict.
Pop off the top of the stack, and add its contents to `s_i`.
If the mapping at the top of the stack share any keys with `s_i`, a `TypeError` is raised.
`s_i` remains on the stack so it can be reused.
Used to implement dict unpacking in function calls.


Example Sources:

```python
my_function(a=1, **b)
# LOAD_CONSTANT('a')
# LOAD_CONSTANT(1)
#
# BUILD_MAP(1)  # Create a dict with items
#               # ('a', 1)
#
# LOAD_FAST(n)  # Load b
#
# DICT_MERGE(1)  # Unpacks b into the result dict,
                 # raise an exception if b has a value
                 # for the key 'a'
```


=== LOAD_ATTR(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... object
Stack After: ... attribute
```

Loads the attribute with the name `co_names[namei]` on the object at the top of the stack; the top of stack is popped.
The value is retrieved by calling the `\\__getattribute__(self, name: str)` method on the type of object with `object` and `co_names[namei]` as the arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# equivalent to
# type(my_object).__getattribute__(my_object, 'attribute')
my_object.attribute
```


=== COMPARE_OP(op)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... left_comparable, right_comparable
Stack After: ... comparison_result
```

A <<BINARY_OP(op)>> that correspond to the comparison operation indicated by the `op` argument.
The comparison operation that `op` refers to is `cmp_op[op]` (where `cmp_op` is https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/174c4bfd0fee4622657a604af7a2e7d20a3f0dbc/Lib/opcode.py#L24[defined here]). In particular:

- 0 corresponds to `\\__lt__` (normal) and `\\__gt__` (reflected)
- 1 corresponds to `\\__le__` (normal) and `\\__ge__` (reflected)
- 2 corresponds to `\\__eq__` (normal) and `\\__eq__` (reflected)
- 3 corresponds to `\\__ne__` (normal) and `\\__ne__` (reflected)
- 4 corresponds to `\\__gt__` (normal) and `\\__lt__` (reflected)
- 5 corresponds to `\\__ge__` (normal) and `\\__le__` (reflected)

The top two items on the top of the stack are popped, the comparison operation is performed, and the result (not necessary a boolean) is pushed to the top of the stack.

Example Sources:

```python
left_comparable < right_comparable
```

```python
left_comparable == right_comparable
```


=== IS_OP(invert)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... left, right
Stack After: ... is_same
```

Pop off the top two items on the stack.
Push `True` if the two items refer to the same reference, `False` otherwise.
If `invert == 1`, then the result is negated.


Example Sources:

```python
left = []
right = []
left is right  # False
```

```python
left = []
right = left
left is right  # True
```

```python
left is not right
```

=== CONTAINS_OP(invert)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... query, container
Stack After: ... is_contained
```

Pop the two top items off the stack.
The top item is the `container`, and the item immediately below it is the `query`.
If `container` has a `\\__contain__(self, object)` method, it is called, and its result is converted to a boolean value (i.e. `None` is converted to `True`).
Otherwise, an iterator is obtained by calling the `\\__iter__` method on `container`.
If the iterator returns an object equal to `query`, `True` is pushed to the stack.
If the iterator get exhausted before that, `False` is pushed to the stack.
If the iterator is infinite and does not contain `query`, an infinite loop occurs.
If `invert == 1`, then the result is negated.

Example Sources:

```python
1 in (1, 2, 3)
```

```python
1 not in (1, 2, 3)
```


=== IMPORT_NAME(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... level, from_list
Stack After: ... module
```

Calls the https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#import__[\_import_] builtin function with the arguments `co_names[namei]`, `globals()`, `locals()`, `from_list` and `level`.
The top two elements of the stack are popped, and the imported module is pushed.
`from_list` can either be `None` or a list of strings containing names to import from the module.
`level` indicates if the import is absolute or relative.
If `level` is `0`, then it is an absolute import (the default).
Otherwise, `level` indicates how many parents directories need to be navigated to perform the relative import (for instance, `1` is same directory as the current module, `2` is parent directory of the current module, `3` is the parent of the parent directory).
The namespace is not modified; that is done by a subsequent <<STORE_FAST[namei]>> instruction(s).

Example Sources:

```python
import module
```

```python
from module import a, b, c
```



=== IMPORT_FROM(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```

=== LOAD_CLASSDEREF(i)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... cell_value
```

If locals has a variable corresponding to the name of slot `i`, push its value.
Otherwise, push the value contained in the cell at slot `i` as described by <<_cell_variable_index>>.
A cell corresponds to either a shared or free variable.
Used to read shared and free variables in class bodies.

Example Sources:

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    class InnerClass:
        my_value = x # LOAD_CLASSDEREF(x) is
                     # used here since x is a
                     # free variable in a class
                     # body.
```

```

Pop off the top of the stack and sets the value contained in the cell at slot `i` as described by <<_cell_variable_index>> to the popped value.
A cell corresponds to either a shared or free variable.
Used to set shared and free variables.

Example Sources:

```python
def outer():
    x = 10  # STORE_DEREF(x) is used here
            # since x is used in inner
    print(x)

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20   # STORE_DEREF(x) is used here
                 # since x is a free variable
    inner()
    print(x) # 20
```


=== DELETE_DEREF(i)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Deletes the value contained in the cell at slot `i` as described by <<_cell_variable_index>>.
The actual cell is NOT deleted, but has no associated
value.
A cell corresponds to either a shared or free variable.
Used to delete shared and free variables.

Example Sources:

```python
def outer():
    x = 10
    del x  # DELETE_DEREF(x) is used here
           # since x is used in inner

```


=== RAISE_VARARGS(argc)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior (argc = 0): ...
Stack Prior (argc = 1): ... exception
Stack Prior (argc = 2): ... exception cause
Stack After: N/A
```

Does one of three things depends on `argc`:

- If `argc = 0`, reraise the last raised exception. Used to implement a bare `raise` in an except block.

- If `argc = 1`, the top of stack is either an exception or an exception type.
If it is an exception instance, raise it; otherwise, create a new instance of the exception type.
Used to implement `raise Exception` and `raise Exception()`

- If `argc = 2`, the top of stack is an exception and the item immediately below it is an exception or an exception type.
If `exception` is an exception instance, set its `\\__cause__` to `cause` and raise it. Otherwise, construct a new instance of `exception`, set its `\\__cause__` to `cause` and raise it.
Used to implement `raise Exception from cause` and `raise Exception() from cause`.

Example Sources:

```python
try:
    # ...
except:
    raise  # argc = 0
```

```python
raise Exception  # argc = 1
```

```python
raise Exception()  # argc = 1
```

```python
raise Exception from cause  # argc = 2
```

```python
raise Exception() from cause  # argc = 2
```


=== KW_NAMES(consti)

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

Sets the keyword names for the next <<CALL(argc)>> opcode to the tuple of strings stored in `co_consts[consti]`.
Used to implement calling a function with keyword arguments

Example Sources:

```python
# Assume co_const[3] = ('a', 'b'),
# then KW_NAMES(3) would be emitted here
my_function(a=1, b=2)
```


=== PRECALL(argc)

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

A NOP.
CPython uses it to allow the specialization of function calls. `argc` is the number of arguments as described in <<CALL(argc)>>.
Used when calling a function.

Example Sources:

```python
# A PRECALL(3) is put here
my_function(1, 2, a=3)
```


=== PUSH_NULL

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ... NULL
```

Pushes `NULL` to the top of the stack.
Used in the call sequence to match the NULL pushed by <<LOAD_METHOD(namei)>> for non-method calls.

Example Sources:

```python
# 3
# A PUSH_NULL is used here
my_function(1, 2, a=3)
```


=== CALL(argc)

Python Versions: >= 3.11

```
Stack Prior (1): ... NULL, callable, arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_{argc}
Stack Prior (2): ... method, object, arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_{argc}
Stack After:     ... return_value
```

Calls a function from the top `argc + 2` items on the stack.
The first `argc` items on the stack are the arguments to the function.
For the arguments, the keyword names internal variable length is checked, and the top `len(keyword names)` items are keyword arguments, and the bottom `argc - len(keyword names)` items are positional arguments.
The two items below the arguments are either:

- An unbound method object and an object
- NULL and an arbitrary callable

If it is NULL and an arbitrary callable, the given positional and keyword arguments are used.
If it is an unbound method object and an object, object is inserted as the first item in the positional argument list.
All the arguments and the two items below the arguments are popped, and the result of the function call is pushed to the top of the stack.
The keyword names are reset to an empty list after this call.
Used to implement function calls that do not unpack an iterable or mapping.

Example Sources:

```python
# This is a CALL in NULL, CALLABLE form
my_function(1, 2, a=3)
```

```python
# This is a CALL in METHOD, OBJECT form
my_object.my_function(1, 2, a=3)
```


=== CALL_FUNCTION(argc)

Python Versions: \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ... callable, arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_{argc}
Stack After: ... return_value
```

Calls a function from the top `argc + 1` items on the stack.
The first `argc` items on the stack are the positional arguments to the function (there are no keyword arguments).
The item below the arguments is the callable to call.
All the arguments and the item below them are popped, and the result of the function call is pushed to the top of the stack.
Used to implement function calls without keyword arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# This is CALL_FUNCTION(3)
function(1, 2, 3)
```


=== CALL_FUNCTION_KW(argc)

Python Versions: \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior: ... callable, arg_1, arg_2, ..., arg_{argc}, kw_names
Stack After: ... return_value
```

Calls a function from the top `argc + 2` items on the stack.
The item on the top of the stack is a tuple containing the names of keyword arguments.
The `argc` items below that are the arguments to the function.
For the arguments, the tuple at the top of the stack length is checked, and the top `len(keyword names)` items are keyword arguments, and the bottom `argc - len(keyword names)` items are positional arguments.
The item below the arguments is the callable to call.
The keyword argument name tuple, arguments and the callable are popped and the result of the function call is pushed to the top of the stack.
Used to implement function calls with keyword arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# This is CALL_FUNCTION_KW(3) with
# the tuple ('arg_1',) at the top of the stack
function(1, 2, arg_1=3)
```


=== CALL_FUNCTION_EX(flags)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior (1): ... function, iterable
Stack Prior (2): ... function, iterable, mapping
Stack Prior (3): ... NULL, function, iterable
Stack Prior (4): ... NULL, function, iterable, mapping
Stack After: ... return_value
```

There are two modes for this function, controlled by its flags:

- If `flags & 1` is set, this is a function call with both positional and keyword arguments, and the stack contains `callable`, `iterable`, `mapping`.
The items in the iterable and mapping are unpacked, and are used to make the function call.
Used to implement `function(*iterable, **mapping)`

- If `flags & 1` is unset, this is a function call with only positional arguments, and the stack contains `callable`, `iterable`.
The items in the iterable are unpacked and are used to make the function call.
Used to implement `function(*iterable)`

If the Python version is at least 3.11, a `NULL` is put beneath callable.
In all cases, the argument containers, callable (and possibly `NULL`) are popped and the returned value is pushed to the top of the stack.


Used to implement function calls that unpack arguments.

Example Sources:

```python
# CALL_FUNCTION_EX(0)
function(*iterable)
```

```python
# CALL_FUNCTION_EX(0)
function(1, 2, 3, *iterable)
```

```python
# CALL_FUNCTION_EX(1)
function(*iterable, **mapping)
```

```python
# CALL_FUNCTION_EX(1)
function(**mapping)
```

```python
# CALL_FUNCTION_EX(1)
function(1, arg=1, *iterable)
```


=== LOAD_METHOD(namei)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior:     ... object
Stack After (1): ... unbound_method, object
Stack After (2): ... function, NULL
Stack After (3): ... NULL, function
```

Load the method with the name `co_names[namei]` from the object at the top of the stack.
If the method exists (and is an instance method, not a class method, static method or a callable), the unbounded method is put beneath the object at the top of the stack.
Otherwise, the object at the top of the stack is popped, attribute lookup is performed, and the result of the lookup is pushed to the stack (with a NULL either before or after the lookup result depending on the Python version).
Used to implement attribute lookups for function calls.

Example Sources:

```python
# This emits LOAD_METHOD
my_object.function()

# This DOES NOT emit LOAD_METHOD
my_onject.function
```


=== CALL_METHOD(argc)

Python Versions: \<= 3.10

```
Stack Prior (1): ... method, object, arg_1, ..., arg_{argc}
Stack Prior (2): ... callable, NULL, arg_1, ..., arg_{argc}
Stack After:     ... return_value
```

Calls a method with `argc` positional arguments (and no keyword arguments).
The top `argc` items on the stack are the positional arguments.
The item immediately below the argument is either an object (which will be used as the self parameter) or NULL.
The item below that is either an unbound method or a callable to call.
All the arguments, the object/NULL, and the method/callable are all popped, and the return value is pushed to the top of the stack.
Used to implement method calls.

Example Sources:

```python
# This emits CALL_METHOD
my_object.function()
```


=== MAKE_FUNCTION(flags)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... [default_positional_args], [default_keyword_args], [annotation_directory_or_tuple], [cell_tuple], function_code, [function_name]
Stack After: ... function
```

Creates a function from the code object.
Expected stack varies depending on `flags` and Python version.

- If the Python version is prior to 3.11, at the top of the stack is the qualified name of the function, with the code object for the function below it.
Otherwise, at the top of the stack is the code object (and the qualified name of the function is received via the code object).

- If `flags & 8` is set, the next item below is a tuple containing the closure for the created function.
The closure is a tuple that consists of the cells the inner function shares with the outer function.

- If `flags & 4` is set, the next item below are the annotations for the created function.
Prior to 3.10, this is a `tuple` containing `(key, value)` pairs.
After 3.10, this is a `dict`.

- If `flags & 2` is set, the next item below are the default values for keyword-only arguments (as a `dict`).

- Finally, if `flags & 1` is set, the next item below are the default values for allow-positional arguments (as a `tuple`).

All these items are popped off the stack and are used to create a new function object, which is pushed to the top of the stack.
Used to create inner functions.

Example Sources:

```python
def outer():
    fun_list = []
    for i in range(10):
        # MAKE_FUNCTION(1)
        def inner(value=i):
            return value
        fun_list.append(inner)
    fun_list[0]() # 0 because it
                  # the default parameter
                  # for fun_list[0]
```

```python
def outer():
    for i in range(10):
        # MAKE_FUNCTION(8)
        def inner():
            return i
        fun_list.append(inner)
    fun_list[0]() # 9 because
                  # it the current value of i
```

```python
def outer():
    # MAKE_FUNCTION(4)
    # on the stack is either
    # (('a', str),) or {'a': str}
    # depending on Python version
    def inner(a: str):
        return a
```

```python
def outer():
    # MAKE_FUNCTION(2)
    def inner(*, keyword_arg=1):
        return keyword_arg
```


=== BUILD_SLICE(argc)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior (argc=2): ... start, end
Stack Prior (argc=3): ... start, end, step
Stack After:          ... function
```

At the top of the stack is either two or three items depending on `argc`:

- If `argc = 2`, at the top of the stack are two objects to use as the start and end index of a slice.
- If `argc = 3`, at the top of the stack are three objects to use as the start, end and step of a slice.

Any items on the stack that are not `int` or `None` are converted to `int` by calling their `\\__index__()` method.
The arguments are popped, and the created slice is pushed to the top of the stack.
Used to implement https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice[slice indexing].

Example Sources:

```python
# BUILD_SLICE(2)
my_list[:]
my_list[1:]
my_list[:2]
my_list[1:-1]

# BUILD_SLICE(3)
my_list[::]
my_list[1::]
my_list[:2:]
my_list[::3]
my_list[1:2:]
my_list[:2:3]
my_list[1:2:3]
```


=== EXTENDED_ARG(ext)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ...
Stack After: ...
```

A NOP.
Used to extend an opcode argument range beyond one byte by prefixing up to three EXTENDED_ARG opcodes before it.

Example Sources:

```python
# Dynamic list of length 260,
# which is too large to fit into a byte (256)
# So EXTENDED_ARG is used to extend
# BUILD_LIST argument like so:
# EXTENDED_ARG(0x01) BUILD_LIST(0x04)
# = BUILD_LIST(0x0104 = 260)
[
 a[0x00], a[0x01], a[0x02], a[0x03],
 a[0x04], a[0x05], a[0x06], a[0x07],
 # ...
 a[0xFC], a[0xFD], a[0xFE], a[0xFF],
 a[0x100], a[0x101], a[0x102], a[0x103]
]
```


=== FORMAT_VALUE(flags)

Python Versions: ALL

```
Stack Prior: ... object, [format_spec]
Stack After: ... formatted_string
```

Formats an object with an optional format specifier string.
Acts different depending on `flags`:

- If `flags & 4` is set, there is a format specifier on the top of the stack, with the object to format below it.
Otherwise, the object to format is at the top of the stack (and `None` will be used as the format specifier).

- If `(flags & 3) == 0`, the object is formatted as is.

- If `(flags & 3) == 1`, the object is converted via `str()` before formatting.

- If `(flags & 3) == 2`, the object is converted via `repr()` before formatting.

- If `(flags & 3) == 3`, the object is converted via `ascii()` before formatting.


Example Sources:

```python
f'{my_object}'    # FORMAT_VALUE(0)
f'{my_object!s}'  # FORMAT_VALUE(1)
f'{my_object!r}'  # FORMAT_VALUE(2)
f'{my_object!a}'  # FORMAT_VALUE(3)
f'{my_object:my_spec}'  # FORMAT_VALUE(4)
f'{my_object!s:my_spec}'  # FORMAT_VALUE(5)
```
