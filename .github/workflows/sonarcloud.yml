      # Because we are using JPype, and JPype add it own import hook, we need to use --import-mode=importlib in pytest
      # This seems to create an issue in test coverage, where it reports coverage inside the tox virtual environment,

      # package name=".tox.py39.lib.python3.9.site-packages.jpyinterpreter"

      # class name="jvm_setup.py" filename=".tox/py39/lib/python3.9/site-packages/jpyinterpreter/jvm_setup.py"
